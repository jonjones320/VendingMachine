# **React Router Vending Machine**

*There is no starter code for this.*

For this assignment, you should use the React Router to build a vending machine! Make sure you install the React Router:

**`$ npm install react-router-dom`**

What does this mean? Your application should consist of the following:

- A ***VendingMachine*** component, which shows a page with a list of snacks that you can get from the vending machine.
- At least three different snack components, each one corresponding to a vending machine snack.
- By clicking on an item in the ***VendingMachine*** you can view one of things inside of the machine. Clicking should update the URL and show the snack that you’ve clicked on.
- From each snack component, you should be able to go back to the main ***VendingMachine*** component.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
